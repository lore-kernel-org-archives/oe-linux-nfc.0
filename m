nfc: pn533: bound the OUT URB wait in pn533_usb_send_frame()

This patch replaces the unbounded wait_for_completion() on the bulk OUT
URB in pn533_usb_send_frame() with a 5000ms wait_for_completion_timeout().
When the timeout expires, it kills the URB and returns -ETIMEDOUT. The
goal is to stop probe() from hanging with the USB device lock held when
the device never completes the OUT transfer.

Closes: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=1c5368988052dc2d8201

[Severity: Medium]
Can this report a failure for a transfer that actually succeeded? The HCD
can give back out_urb with status 0 after wait_for_completion_timeout()
returns 0 but before usb_kill_urb() runs. In that case usb_kill_urb() does
nothing, and the function still returns -ETIMEDOUT.

__pn533_send_async() or pn533_wq_cmd() then frees the cmd and clears
dev->cmd, and no in_urb gets submitted. The chip still sends an ACK and a
response for the command it received. Those would then be read as the
reply to the next command. That command would fail with -EIO, or get
stale data if its command code is the same.

The commit message cites usb_bulk_msg() as precedent. Its helper,
usb_start_wait_urb(), checks the real completion status after the kill:

drivers/usb/core/message.c:usb_start_wait_urb() {
    ...
	if (rc <= 0) {
		usb_kill_urb(urb);
		if (ctx.status != -ENOENT)
			retval = ctx.status;
		else if (rc == 0)
			retval = -ETIMEDOUT;
    ...
}

Could the same be done here? For example, pn533_out_complete() could
record the URB status in struct pn533_out_arg.

The kill could also land after some max-packet chunks of a multi-packet
frame have already been accepted. That would leave the chip holding a
partial frame, or an ACR122 CCID message shorter than dwLength. Should the
timeout path resync the chip? pn533_usb_abort_cmd() and
pn533_usb_send_ack() already send an ACK abort frame for non-ACR122
devices.

[Severity: High]
The commit message says -ETIMEDOUT is something "__pn533_send_async()
already unwinds". Is that accurate for every caller? It holds for the
direct send path. A queued command, though, is sent from pn533_wq_cmd(),
and its error branch looks like this:

drivers/nfc/pn533/pn533.c:pn533_wq_cmd() {
    ...
	rc = pn533_send_cmd_frame(dev, cmd);
	if (rc < 0) {
		dev->cmd = NULL;
		dev_kfree_skb(cmd->req);
		kfree(cmd);
		return;
	}
}

That branch never calls cmd->complete_cb and never clears
dev->cmd_pending.

Queuing can happen during probe. pn533_wq_cmd_complete() wakes the sync
waiter before cmd_work runs:

	rc = pn533_send_async_complete(dev);
	if (rc != -EINPROGRESS)
		queue_work(dev->wq, &dev->cmd_work);

dev->cmd_pending is only cleared in pn533_wq_cmd(), and only when the
queue is empty. So the probe thread can issue its next sync command from
pn533_setup() (for example via pn533_set_configuration()) while
cmd_pending is still 1. __pn533_send_async() then queues that command
instead of sending it.

If that command's OUT URB then hits this new timeout, can the probe
thread get stuck forever in wait_for_completion(&arg.done) inside
pn533_send_cmd_sync()?

Outside of probe, would async callers leak their complete_cb_context?
And would cmd_pending stay at 1, so every later command is queued and
never sent?

Before this patch, the pn533_wq_cmd() error branch was only reachable
when usb_submit_urb() failed.

[Severity: High]
Does this fully stop probe() from hanging? pn533_out_complete() calls
complete() for any URB status. Once out_urb completes, nothing here checks
out_urb->status. The function submits in_urb for the ACK or the response
and returns 0.

The probe thread then waits here:

drivers/nfc/pn533/pn533.c:pn533_send_cmd_sync() {
    ...
	rc = pn533_send_cmd_async(dev, cmd_code, req,
				  pn533_send_sync_complete, &arg);
    ...
	wait_for_completion(&arg.done);
    ...
}

That completion is only signalled from cmd_complete_work. cmd_complete_work
is only queued when in_urb completes, via pn533_recv_ack() or
pn533_recv_frame(). The USB transport has no command timeout, and
abort_cmd is only called from the poll and listen paths.

So a device that accepts (or stalls) the bulk OUT transfer but never sends
anything on bulk IN could still hang this chain:

pn533_usb_probe()
  pn533_finalize_setup()
    pn533_get_firmware_version()
      pn533_send_cmd_sync()
        wait_for_completion(&arg.done)

That would happen inside hub_event() with the USB device lock held. Isn't
that the same hang the commit message describes? Would the wait need to be
bounded, or the command aborted, at the pn533_send_cmd_sync() level
instead?
